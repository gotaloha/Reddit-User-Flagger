# Reddit User Flagger

This is a Chrome extension that simply injects 2 small buttons near every comment's user name within a Reddit thread. These buttons allow a user to "flag" users that exhibit either poor or outstanding behavior or comments.

Scenario: You are browsing the /r/Politics thread and you continually read comments from someone acting like a complete jerk. Day after day you keep seeing horrible comments, look at the user name, and think, "Oh, this asshole again!"

You click the red button next to their name and their entire comment becomes red... and every other comment that this person has made or will ever make will also be flagged - until you remove them from the "asshole list" by once again clicking on the button.

Similarly, posters that you encounter who always seem to bring good info and vibes to every post can also be flagged so that you don't miss any of their posts.

Each user name is stored in your browser's "local storage" and is personal and private to you and you alone. And no, other users have no way of knowing that you have flagged them.
